- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ItsGifNotJif
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in becoming a Full-Stack developer.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript, and gotta say, it freaking sucks. It feels like the language was created by some fandom,
- and only inner circle can read and understand it, just like Magic The Gathering lore was written by MTG nerds for MTG nerds.
- I'm just hoping to learn it sometime soon, and hopefully sooner rather than later.
- P.S. It is Gif, not Jif. I'm ready to die on that hill if I have to.
